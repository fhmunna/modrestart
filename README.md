# MOD RESTART #

A simple command line script to restart ZyXel MAX-206M1R and other series from the same family.

# What did I do? 

    cp modrestart.php ~/.bin/modrestart
    chmod a+x modrestart
    
Then added `~/.bin` to my system path. 


PS: I also wrote an experimental ruby version which could be found in the "ruby" branch of this repository.
